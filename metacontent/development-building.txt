{heading:Building OpenFX}
<p>
The first step is to <a href="{url:download.html}">get the source</a>.
To compile OpenFX, you will need to have the Microsoft Visual C compiler installed and at
least 200Mb free disk space.  Extract the source to your working directory using an unzip
utility such as <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a>.  Make sure you have the setup
Visual C to to allow you to run the compiler from the command line.  Change to your working
directory and run the 'makeall.bat' script.  OpenFX should start compiling.  When this has
finished (it may take a few minutes) you should be able to run the openfx.exe from that
directory.
