install:	Once you have downloaded the package, the chull.dll and chull.afx file
		need to be extracted using a tool such as WinZip and placed
		in the plugins directory inside the directory that you installed OpenFX
		(eg. C:\OpenFX\plugins\).   The DLL is the library that executes the
		action and the AFX files contain the text used in the Plugin Actions
		submenu of the Actions menu.

		If you download the source, it should be extracted to the design directory
		in the openfx source distribution.
