author:		<a href="mailto:rodney@qwest.net">Rodney Butrymowicz</a>
version:	1.0
modules:	1
source:		trisect_src.zip
file:		trisect.zip
install:	Once you have downloaded the package, the trisect.dll and trisect.afx
		files need to be extracted using a tool such as WinZip and placed
		in the plugins directory inside the directory that you installed OpenFX
		(eg. C:\OpenFX\plugins\).   The DLL is the library that executes the
		action and the AFX files contain the text used in the Plugin Actions
		submenu of the Actions menu.
		<br /><br />
		If you download the source, it should be extracted to the design directory
		in the openfx source distribution.
overview:	This implements the 'square root of 3' subdivision algorithm.  This is
		similar to the tessalate plugin, but it does smoothing and edge rotation.
