install:	Once you have downloaded the package, the metaspline.dll and metaspling.afx
		files need to be extracted using a tool such as WinZip and placed
		in the plugins directory inside the directory that you installed OpenFX
		(eg. C:\OpenFX\plugins\).   The DLL is the library that executes the
		action and the AFX files contain the text used in the Plugin Actions
		submenu of the Actions menu.

		If you download the source, it should be extracted to the design directory
		in the openfx source distribution.

		<a href="metaspline.html">documentation file</a>
		explaining how to use this plugin and some example model files to demonstrate it.
overview:	This plugin is an implementation of metashape modelling, also known as
		'blobs' or 'metaballs'.  This currently supports two types of metashape -
		metaballs and metasplines.  MetaSplines are exactly like POVRAY Cylindrical
		Blobs except that each end can have it's own Strength and Radius properties.
