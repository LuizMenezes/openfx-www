step1:  <b>Step 1</b><br /><br />
	Start Designer select 'Insert Primitive' from the tool bar and create an object.
step2:  <b>Step 2</b><br /><br />
	It's always a good idea to colour each piece of geometry to help with
        identifying it later. To access the materials attributes press F8 or
        go to attributes &gt; materials setting in the menu bar.  Then
        deselect the newly created geometry by pressing Ctrl+D.
step3:  <b>Step 3</b><br /><br />
	Create another object, move it by pressing m or selecting the move tool
        on the tool bar so that it intersects the first object you made. This
        new object will be the tool object for the boolean process. Don't forget
        to give it a new colour in the materials editor. Leave this
        object selected for the time being.
step4:  <b>Step 4</b><br /><br />
	In the Actions menu select Boolean.
step5:  <b>Step 5</b><br /><br />
	For a subtractive Boolean leave all the setting as they are and press OK.
step6:  <b>Step 6</b><br /><br />
	Now the Boolean operation is complete you have four pieces of geometry:
        tool, workpiece and two cut objects formed from the intersection of the
        two primary objects.
step7:  <b>Step 7</b><br /><br />
	Select none (Ctrl+D) and then object select any vertex within the new
        booleaned objects.  This will highlight the objects vertices turning them
        yellow.  Now delete this object.
step8:  <b>Step 8</b><br /><br />
	What you have left is the original tool object and a new cut away of the
        workpiece.
step9:  <b>Step 9</b><br /><br />
	With the two objects selected go to the Actions menu and perform a weld
        command (leave the settings as they are). This will combine the two
        object into one single object.
        <br /><br />
        Have Fun.
