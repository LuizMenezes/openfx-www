step1:		<b>Step 1</b><br /><br />
		Make a tube object in designer. This will be a basic arm which will have a skeleton
		applied to it, so scale and proportion it to look something like an arm.
		<br /><br />
		To help with modelling use the subdivided tool (Ctrl+V) to add more detail to selected
		verticies.
step2:		<b>Step 2</b><br /><br />
		Now to add the joints with a basic skeletal frame. The skeleton is just a set of joints
		attached to selected vertices which will modify the mesh when moved.
step3:		<b>Step 3</b><br /><br />
		With nothing selected, select Edit &gt; Skeleton &gt; Build joints.  This will open a
		floating tool bar.  Hover over each of the buttons in the floating menu will give you a
		brief description.
		<br /><br />
		Select move and click on the root joint (this is the initial joint) it's the small yellow
		box.  Reposition it at the top of the arm mesh.
		<br /><br />
		Think of the root as the shoulder, which in this exercise do not need to move.
step4:		<b>Step 4</b><br /><br />
		Now select build in the floating tool bar.  Click on the root and with the left mouse
		button still held down drag the pointer to the middle of the mesh and let go of the mouse
		button.  A dialog box will open prompting you for a name for the new joint you just made.
		Call it elbow.
step5:		<b>Step 5</b><br /><br />
		Do the same as above but click on the elbow joint and drag down to the end of the mesh.
		Call this joint hand.
step6:		<b>Step 6</b><br /><br />
		With the joints made and in position we can attached the separate joints to the necessary
		vertices.  Close the build joints menu and open the Hierarchy Joints floating menu. Select
		the elbow joint in the hierarchy window. In the rear window lasso the top three rows of
		vertices (see opposite).  Go back to the hierarchy menu and press attach.  This will assign
		the selected vertices to the elbow joint.  You can now deselect these vertices by pressing
		deselect.
step7:		<b>Step 7</b><br /><br />
		Do the same for the hand joint but this time select the bottom two rows of vertices (see
		image).
		<br /><br />
		Save your newly make arm and go into animator.
step8:		<b>Step 8</b><br /><br />
		Set animation length to 30 frames and load the newly created object as a robot.
step9:		<b>Step 9</b><br /><br />
		With the robot loaded insert a key frame in the robots costume time line at frame 15. Make
		sure the keyframer window is open so that you can see the time line ( press 'k' to open
		keyframer).  In the camera view press on the Go To Frame button and enter 15. This is the
		newly created key frame for your arm which is required before you can modify the mesh with
		your skeleton.
		<br /><br />
		Remember a costume keyframe has to be made and the Go To Frame has to be on that frame
		before you can use the skeleton.
step10:		<b>Step 10</b><br /><br />
		Select the robot actor by pressing 'a' and clicking on robot1.  Press 'v' this will display
		the robot view.  In the robot hierarchy window select the hand joint and rotate it about
		the y axis in any view port this will create a key frame pose for your object.
		<br /><br />
		To create the effect of the object bending insert a key frame at 2 without repositioning any
		of the joints and follow steps 9-10.
