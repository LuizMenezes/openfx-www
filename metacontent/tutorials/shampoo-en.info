step1:	<b>Step 1</b><br /><br />
	Using the pen tool create the three main components of the bottle: Lid, Body and Liquid.
	To help later on its better to construct the profiles about the Z axes (see opposite). 
	<br /><br />
	Try to leave a small gap between all the components so no geometry is intersection any
	other component, it will look better when finally rendering.
step2:	<b>Step 2</b><br /><br />
	Selecting each profile separately apply the Lathe tool with a setting of
	14 segments and 360 degrees. As you lathe each profile assign a material
	in the Attributes menu or press F8. The setting are:
	<a href="{resources}/lid-texture-attributes.jpg">LID</a>,
	<a href="{resources}/bottle-texture-attributes.jpg">BODY</a>, and
	<a href="{resources}/outer-liquid-surface-attributes.jpg">LIQUID</a>.
	Use a refraction index setting of 1.50 (glass) for the body texture and
	1.333 (water) for the liquid.
	<br /><br />
	Remember: when rendering a refraction surface turn on trace shadows and
	trace reflections.
hint2:	Hint: To Lathe accurately about the center, open the Display Co-ordinates dialog box in
	the view menu. Click anywhere in the top view and change X, Y, Z in the
	Display Co-ordinates box to 0,0,0. Then Actions &gt; Lathe or Ctrl+L.
step3:	<b>Step 3</b><br /><br />
	Now to select the faces that will have a Decal mapping applied to them,
	for the label. Using the selector tool from the tool bar hold down shift
	and lasso the front 5 vertices top and bottom. With these selected go
	into Attributes &gt; materials settings and open the maps tab. Here
	select set and choose &lt;new&gt;. Amend the menu to look like
	<a href="{resources}/applying-map-to-bottle.jpg">this example</a>.
hint3:	Hint: Selecting the required vertices couldn't be easier, just remember what
	ever you want to zoom in on must me visible in all three view ports
	before you can select it.
step4:	<b>Step 4</b><br /><br />
	Some sections of the label image are not required these sections can be
	made transparent by telling OpenFX which colour isn't required in the
	Decal Colour section of the Image Map Settings dialog box. In this
	dialog box we must also select the label which is to be applied to the
	surface as a still image.
step5:	<b>Step 5</b><br /><br />
	Still in the Image Map Setting dialog box, press the move button. A
	small floating menu will appear, in the rear view window click on the
	top left hand vertex were the map will go and press the T/L button then
	click on the top right vertex and press T/R click on the bottom
	left vertex and press B/L and finally press Done. The Decal is now
	positioned.
	<br /><br />
	Save the file as bottle.
step6:	<b>Step 6</b><br /><br />
	From the original file we'll produce two. One for the bottle and lid and
	the other for the liquid. Copy the original file and open it, delete the
	lid and bottle objects and select the liquid. In the Actions menu select
	Duplicate, click ok. Now we have a copy of the liquid object. Double
	click on the scale icon and reduce it in all axis to .99 click on scale
	vertices and scale from center. Now flip the normals using Actions &gt;
	Reverse and change the material to
	<a href="{resources}/inner-liquid-surface-attributes.jpg">this example.</a>
	Save this file as liquid. Open the original file, delete the liquid and
	save the file as bottle.
step7:	<b>Step 7</b><br /><br />
	Create a new file for the backdrop object .Using a single extruded
	polygon and assign the plate plugin as a texture. Set the Scale for X,
	Y, Z to 3.0, don't select dirty plate and have colour variation as 0.0.
	Save this as wall.
step8:	<b>Step 8</b><br /><br />
	In animator load the bottle and liquid model. If they appear in
	different places select one at a time, double click the move icon and
	set the X, Y, Z to 0,0,0. Load the wall object and position as opposite.
	This scene has been light with a spot light for the refraction surfaces
	and a general omni light. A ground object forms the floor and a sky
	object set to gradient of pale blue / light yellow.
	<br /><br />
	Play with the lighting and sky to get the best balance of colour and shadows.
step9:	<b>Step 9</b><br /><br />
	Render the scene with trace reflection and trace shadows and trace glass on. Be
	warned this does take a long time, so go make yourself a cup of tea and
	sit back.
