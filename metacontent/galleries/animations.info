artist:		<a href="mailto:rodney@qwest.net">Rodney Butrymowicz</a>
brief:		This is an animation demonstrating the features of a physics simulation
		package developed by Rodney Butrymowicz.  This is an example of a mass/spring
		simulation with gravity and a semi-permeable ground.
info:		These are examples of a mass/spring simulation with gravity and a
		semi-permeable ground.  I have a couple of quirky utilities to generate a series
		of frames (one for each frame of the animation) and the necessary ANI file for a
		morph object.  Obviously several objects can be done seperately and combined in
		the Animator.  The stellated cube animation is 240 frames and was generated in
		about 30 seconds, the ring animation is 300 frames and took about 45 minutes to
		generate. (600 MHz PIII)
		<br /><br />
		The utilities I have written allow for many more forces (ElectroMagnetic Fields,
		Muscles, Drag, ..) and also some simple constraints (a vertex may be allowed to
		move freely in a plane, but cannot move off of the plane). 
		<br /><br />
		The changes/additions I have in mind begin with the ability to edit vertex and
		edge properties in the Designer module.  This would include Mass, Velocity,
		spring coeficients, and various other properties (Charge, Lifespan, ...)  Also
		modifications to the import/export routines for additional chunks in the MFX
		format. 
		<br /><br />
		Plug-Ins would be necessary to provide internal bracing for models, and the
		ability to turn off automatic face creation when linking exactly two vertices.
		Perhaps others have ideas for appropriate tools to edit velocity (impart spin) 
		<br /><br />
		I will also provide the ring object to show how internal bracing supports the
		object and how "naked" edges are used to specify velocity.

brief:		This animation demonstrates 'cloth draping', and effect which acurately
		models the effect of dropping a flexible material onto a hard surface.
		This is another very impressive demonstration of Rodney's physical modelling
		animation system.
info:		<p>Well, I've been plugging away at my utility - I think I'll call it DynaFX.</p>
		<p>This is an example of just one effect that can be done with the system -
		Cloth Draping.</p>
