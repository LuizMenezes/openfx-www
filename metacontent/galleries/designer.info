brief:		A typical view of the modelling module, viewing a fire-hose nozzle.  The
		view on the top-right is a real-time OpenGL preview of the module using
		default lighting and camera angles.  The rest are wireframe views from
		different angles.  Also notice the menu open on the bottom right.

brief:		In this screenshot, a 'quick render' has been performed, and the OpenGL

brief:		Fido the lovable OpenFX dog is viewed here in skeletal format.  The popup
		menu is the skeleton hierarchy, and the wireframe view is in 'pose mode'
		where the joints can be manipulated.
