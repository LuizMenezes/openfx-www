brief:		Firehose nozzle rendered with high-quality anti-aliasing, all raytrace
		settings on, to a TGA, then converted to a PNG and optimized for size
		with pngcrush.

brief:		A demonstration of the post-processing FireballFX module in OpenFX.
		The glow around the planet is generated by using this plugin.  There are
		over 30 other such plugins included, ranging from lens flares to snow
		effects to firework particles.

brief:		This Technics turntable demonstrates image mapping onto a surface; notice
		the text on the front of it.  The model also has kinematic constraints on
		how it can turn, but this is obviously not reflected in this static image.

brief:		This image was created on the artist's first day using OpenFX.  It shows
		use of the OpenFX font tool and the depth of field post processing effect.

artist:		<a href="mailto:cae47844@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu">Christopher Elwell</a>
brief:		This image was created entirely using OpenFX.  This is a very good example
		of the quality and detail of images that can be produced by OpenFX.
info:		Model of an X-Wing created entirely in OFX.  55,805 vertices, 127380 faces.
		The model in the image takes up nearly 60MB of hard drive space because the
		textures have been made huge for future texture detail work and the OFX
		geometry takes up 6MB with all the fixed-to maps applied.  Needless to say,
		this took some time to make.
		<br /><br />
		The image is an OFX Animator scene with a background generated in Diard
		Software's Universe.  Filters used in OFX included lens flare and explosions.
		The image was resized from 3072x2304 to 1024x768 and color reduced in PaintShop
		Pro 5 to remove any remaining aliasing and smooth the image's colors.
		<br /><br />
		I think the results speak for themselves.  If you've got the time and patience,
		you can make professional-quality art with OFX, no problem! 
		<br /><br />
		I'll gladly e-mail the original bitmaps to anyone interested.  Just tell me
		what you want.  Also, this is part of a larger project and I'm looking for
		someone out there to give me some texturing pointers. Any takers?

brief:		A very nice example of using NURBS to model curved surfaces.
info:		Nurbs at work, this is a great tool. This is my first attempt using nurbs,
		still a little rough but worlds apart from before nurbs. Using SoftFX until
		downloading OpenFX last week. Thanks to all those who are willing to share
		their talents so that we can play.
