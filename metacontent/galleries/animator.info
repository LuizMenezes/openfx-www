brief:		A different view of the animator, with the preview screen maximised, and
		a 'quick render' drawn in there as a rough idea of what the current frame
		looks like.  Also notice one of the menus is open on the bottom right.

brief:		Check out the keyframer at the bottom of this shot, along with the co-ordinate
		window floating on the bottom right.  The render preview on the top right
		window demonstrates the volumetric fog post-processing plugin, and there is a
		speedy wireframe of the animation going on to the left.
