{heading:Developing plugins for OpenFX}
<p>
OpenFX supports plugins which allow users to enhance the feature set by installing
small code modules.  There are currently plugins for programmatic textures, model effects
(such as model deformations), image postprocessing (eg. volumetric effects and image
blurring) and others.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, there will be documentation for developing plugins for OpenFX here.
For now, though, your best bet for documentation is to look at the source files in each
of the effects/, postprocess/, presets/ and textures/ directories.  There
should also be a readme.txt file in those directories with a brief discussion of how
to write a plugin.
