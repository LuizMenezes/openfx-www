body:    Dr. Stuart Ferguson has announced that a new version of OpenFX is available for
	 <a href="download.html">download</a>.
         This version fixes some minor bugs and adds a major feature of Stereography
     	 support.
	 <ul>
         <li>On supported hardware (with a 3-pin DIN plug) and OpenGL Left/Right
	 buffering capability you can visualise your model animations and make 3D movies in stereo</li>
	 <li>The OpenGL window in the Designer Animator has been extended to support stereo</li>
	 flag on the OpenGL window.</li>
	 <li>In the animator module you select the Parallax Separation via a slider</li>
         <li>In the <tt>OFXVIEW.EXE</tt> program you can make your models spin with 3D depth perception</li>
	 <li>If you render two FLC files for LEFT and RIGHT eye views you can use the <tt>GGPLAY.EXE</tt>
	 utility to play back the movies in Stereo. Try out the example stereo animations in the
	 Record Deck and the Underwater_Stereo file</li>
	 <li>A DirectDraw player <tt>DDPLAY.EXE</tt> is also included in the distribution so that
	 FLC and AVI movies rendered with OFX can be played back in full screen mode</li>

	 For example <tt>D:\OpenFX</tt> is fine.  This is being looked at for the next
	 version, so that the absolute file-paths can be replaced with something relative.
