{heading:Plugin libraries}
<p>
The <a href="plugins/index.html">plugin library repository</a> is now up.
This contains a list of plugins available which can be installed to enhance
the feature set of OpenFX.  Note that these are all optional. For a list of
plugins included in the official OpenFX distribution, please visit the
<a href="../about-plugins.html">plugins page</a>.
</p>

{heading:Shortcut references}
<p>
A description of the <a href="shortcuts/index.html">shortcut keys</a> available
in OpenFX has been kick-started by Keith Kelly.  These describe what keys are
bound to actions in OpenFX and how they are affected by the Shift, Alt and
Ctrl modifier keys.
</p>

{heading:Image map packages}
<p>
Our <a href="imagemaps/index.html">image map packages</a> contain image maps
useful for your animations and models.  Image maps are images placed on the
surface of polygons to add detail without increasing the computation that has
to be performed when rendering an image.
