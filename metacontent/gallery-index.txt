{heading:OpenFX gallery and screenshots}

<p>
You can find here a number of screenshots and examples of output
images rendered using the OpenFX package.  It is split up into 
sections, to give you a better idea of what each of the individual
modules in the package do.

<p>
If you are proud of any image you've produced using OpenFX, please
submit it to the <a href="mailto:users@openfx.org">users@openfx.org</a>
mailing list, and we'll be happy to add it to the gallery.  Do not
attach the actual images to the mail, but post a web URL where we
can grab them from.
