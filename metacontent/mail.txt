{heading:Mailing Lists}
<p>
The primary method for communicating between developers is via mailing-lists,
which are associated with a particular topic of interest. When choosing which
ones to subscribe to, please read the purpose of that list carefully, and do
not post to the wrong one.</p>

To subscribe to the list, simply send a blank e-mail to
<b><i>listname</i>-subscribe@openfx.org</b> and follow the instructions
that will be sent to you.  Daily digests of the lists are also available, if you
send a blank e-mail to <b><i>listname</i>-digest-subscribe@openfx.org</b>.
