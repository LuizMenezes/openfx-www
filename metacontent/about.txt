{heading:What is OpenFX?}
<p>
OpenFX is an Open-Source 3D modeling, animation and rendering suite
created by <a href="mailto:stuart@openfx.org">Dr. Stuart Ferguson</a>.
He made the decision to release the source code to the public in the
middle of 1999, and the product formerly named SoftF/X was renamed
to <b>OpenFX</b>.  It has now been released under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence</a>.
</p>
<p>
<i>(Stuart will hopefully fill in more of the history of OpenFX here.)</i>
</p>

{heading:What can OpenFX do?}
<p>
A powerful feature-set includes a full renderer and
raytrace engine, NURBS support, kinematics-based animation, 
morphing, and an extensive plugin API. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="about-plugins.html">Plugin capabilities</a> include image post
processor effects such as lens flare, fog and depth of field.  Animation
effects such as explosions, waves and dissolves add enormously to the
flexibility of the program.  Check out the
<a href="about-plugins.html">full list</a> of the various effect types
and let your imagination run wild!

{heading:What platforms does OpenFX run on?}
<p>
Currently, OpenFX only runs on the <b>Win32</b> platform, which
includes Windows 95/98/NT/2000.  There are plans afoot to port
it to <b>Linux/*BSD platforms</b>, and it currently runs fairly well
under these by using the <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</a>
set of libraries.  If you are interested in helping to port to 
these platforms, please join our <a href="{url:mail.html}">Development
Mailing Lists</a> and help out!
