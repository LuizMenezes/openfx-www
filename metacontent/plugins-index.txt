{heading:Plugins}
<p>
This page contains a list of plugins which can enhance the functionality
of OpenFX.  These are binary files containing code that will be used by
OpenFX to perform tasks such as image preprocessing and model animation
effects.  The plugin libraries on this page are optional - they are not
needed to run OpenFX.  For a list of the plugins included in the official
OpenFX distribution, please see our
<a href="{url:about-plugins.html}">Plugin section</a>.
</p>

{heading:Contributing}
<p>
Plugins can be written by anyone with a C compiler and a working knowledge
of C and OpenFX.  Tutorials of how to write a plugin will soon be available
at our <a href="{url:development/index.html">Development page</a>.  If you have
written a plugin and would like it to be included on this page (or even in
the official OpenFX distribution), please mail
<a href="mailto:dom@openfx.org?subject=Plugin%20submission">dom@openfx.org</a>
with the plugin libraries and a description of what each module does.
