heading: OpenFX 2.0 beta2 available, with hardware GPU rendering
poster:  <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a>
body:    The long-awaited update to OpenFX to include hardware rendering is now <a href="download.html">available for download</a>, with the following changes: <ul> <li>Source built with Visual Studio Solution files.</li> <li>Experimental hardware GPU rendering.  Many (not all) programmable shaders are working.  A few of these are nVidia hardware specific and ATI hardware is known to have issues with, for example, the blisters shader.</li> <li>A particle actor is installed which only works with the GPU renderer.  Effects include flames, clouds, sparks, inferno, moving fire and fluids flowing from a pipe.</li> <li>OFX model formats changed to accommodate Maps and Materials.</li> <li>In this new regime each polygon/face can have an image map and a material applied to it. The old OpenFX 1.x face descriptions can still be used for basic properties like colour and smoothing but all the texturing must now be done through the materials.</li> <li>Image mapping has been significantly changed with some of the attributes that previously were attached to individual faces now applied to the image map itself (e.g tiling or shading).</li> <li>All vertices now carry image map coordinates.</li> <li>The new model files now embed the image maps directly, so there is no need to store them separately.</li> <li><b>We strongly recommend that you do not erase or overwrite any of your older model or animation files from OpenFX 1.x and make new copies of them for use with the 2.x beta.</b></li> </ul>

heading: OpenFX 1.1 released!
poster:  <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a>
body:    Dr. Stuart Ferguson has announced that a new version of OpenFX is available for
	 <a href="download.html">download</a>.
         This version fixes some minor bugs and adds a major feature of Stereography
     	 support.
	 <ul>
         <li>On supported hardware (with a 3-pin DIN plug) and OpenGL Left/Right
	 buffering capability you can visualise your model animations and make 3D movies in stereo</li>
	 <li>The OpenGL window in the Designer Animator has been extended to support a stereo flag on the OpenGL window.</li>
	 <li>In the animator module you select the Parallax Separation via a slider</li>
         <li>In the <tt>OFXVIEW.EXE</tt> program you can make your models spin with 3D depth perception</li>
	 <li>If you render two FLC files for LEFT and RIGHT eye views you can use the <tt>GGPLAY.EXE</tt>
	 utility to play back the movies in Stereo. Try out the example stereo animations in the
	 Record Deck and the Underwater_Stereo file</li>
	 <li>A DirectDraw player <tt>DDPLAY.EXE</tt> is also included in the distribution so that
	 FLC and AVI movies rendered with OFX can be played back in full screen mode</li>
