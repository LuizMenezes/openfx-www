{heading:Image map packages}
<p>
Image maps are images that can be placed on to the surface of polygons to add
detail without increasing the number of polygons or geometry calculations
that need to be performed.  This is also known as texture mapping.

<p>
This page contains image map packages - collections of images that you can
use in your own models and animations to improve the realism of a scene.
